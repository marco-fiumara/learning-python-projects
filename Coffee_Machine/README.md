# Coffee Machine: Easy

What can be better than a cup of coffee during a break? A coffee that you don’t have to make yourself. It’s enough to press a couple of buttons on the machine and you get a cup of energy; but first, we should teach the machine how to do it. In this project, you will work on programming a coffee machine simulator. The machine works with typical products: coffee, milk, sugar, and plastic cups; if it runs out of something, it shows a notification. You can get three types of coffee: espresso, cappuccino, and latte. Since nothing’s for free, it also collects the money.

### The Coffee Machine activity helped to reinforce the basic concepts, such as:

- classes
- instances
- methods
- methods and attributes
- magic methods (e.g. \_\_init\_\_)

### Instructions:

Open up terminal and `cd` into the directory containing the 'Coffee_Machine' folder and run `python main.py`

The program works through the instantiation of a new object and the execution of one method.

The program will let you execute a number of commands, all of which are outlined within the console.

### Example:

The following is an example interaction of a user using the program.

(NOTE: The `>` you see is not included in the program, but indicates where the user has inputted information)

```
