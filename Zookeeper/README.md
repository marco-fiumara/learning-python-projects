# Zookeeper: Easy

This short code challenge can help the local zoo look after its denizens. You will create a tool for monitoring animals and their status.

### The Zookeeper activity helped to reinforce the basic concepts, such as:

- printing and taking input
- variables
- data storage types (lists)
- indexes
- while loops
- if statements
- PEP 8 coding conventions
- commenting conventions
- integer arithmetic
- boolean logic
- naming variables
- comparisons
- membership testing

### Instructions:

Open up terminal and `cd` into the directory containing the 'Zookeeper' folder and run `python main.py`

The program will prompt you to enter a number.

Based on the number you enter, you will be shown an ASCII image of an animal, representing the camera feed of the habitat number you entered.

The program will loop around until you type `exit`.

### Example:

The following is an example interaction of a user using the program.

(NOTE: The `>` you see is not included in the program, but indicates where the user has inputted information)

Which habitat # do you need? > 3

Switching on camera from the habitat with a lovely goose...
