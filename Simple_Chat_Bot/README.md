# Simple Chat Bot: Easy

Here, at the beginning of your programmer’s path, creating a simple console chat bot will do wonders to guide you through the basics of coding. During this journey you will also play some word and number games that you are going to implement all on your own. Pack up and let’s hit the road, my friend!

### The Simple Chat Bot activity helped to reinforce the basic concepts, such as:

- all concepts from the Zookeeper activity
- 'f' strings
- functions and arguments

### Instructions:

Open up terminal and `cd` into the directory containing the 'Simple_Chat_Bot' folder and run `python main.py`

The program will simulate having a conversation with you, asking for your name, and playing games with you such as: guessing your age and a quiz.

### Example:

The following is an example interaction of a user using the program.

(NOTE: The `>` you see is not included in the program, but indicates where the user has inputted information)

```
Hello! My name is Aid.
I was created in 2020.
Please, remind me your name.
> Max
What a great name you have, Max!
Let me guess your age.
Say me remainders of dividing your age by 3, 5 and 7.
> 1
> 2
> 1
Your age is 22: that's a good time to start programming!
Now I will prove to you that I can count to any number you want.
> 3
0 !
1 !
2 !
3 !
Let's test your programming knowledge.
Why do we use methods?
1. To repeat a statement multiple times.
2. To decompose a program into several small subroutines.
3. To determine the execution time of a program.
4. To interrupt the execution of a program.

Please, try again.

Completed, have a nice day!
Congratulations, have a nice day!
