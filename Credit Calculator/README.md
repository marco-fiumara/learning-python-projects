# Credit Calculator activity: Intermediate

### The Credit Calculator activity helped to reinforce the basic concepts, such as:

- math module
- terminal / command line
- running files and passing arguments from the terminal

### Instructions:

1. Open up terminal and enter the following command. (NOTE: this command is if you are in the Credit Calculator directory in the terminal, if you aren't, you can also do this by putting the full path to (and including) the main.py file):
   `python [file path / filename (incl. extension) i.e. main.py] --type=[annuity or diff] --principal=[int] --periods=[int] --interest=[int or float] --payment[int or float]`
