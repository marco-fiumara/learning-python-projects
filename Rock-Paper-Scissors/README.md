# Rock-Paper-Scissors: Intermediate

If youâ€™ve ever wanted to create games, this project will get you started! In this project you will code a Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock game, a more advanced version of Rock-Paper-Scissors, which can be played against the computer.

### The Rock-Paper-Scissors activity helped to reinforce the basic concepts, such as:

- opening files
- reading files
- overwriting files
- appending information / updating files
- print() sep and end
- string slicing

### Instructions:

Open up terminal and `cd` into the directory containing the 'Rock-Paper-Scissors' folder and run `python main.py`

The program will prompt you to enter your name, then after greeting you, will let you input custom options.

If you do not wish to utilise custom options, you can simply press `return`.

The custom options must consist of an odd number, and will be put into a format where a selected option will loose to half the other options, and will beat the other half.

An example of this can be found [here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/xgoX1.jpg)
